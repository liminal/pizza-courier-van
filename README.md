# pizza-courier-van

A demo app implementating the Pizza ordering api at http://docs.pizzaapp.apiary.io/

# How do I run it?

Just open the project in android studio, it's a standard gradle project and should run with no special
magic required.

# What does it do?

## step 1: List of pizza restaurants
When you open the app you will get a list of pizza restaurants.
You will also have the option of giving the app access to your location.
If it gets a location it will sort the list of restaurants by distance and show you the closest one
on a fancy teal background.

Enjoy the pretty list for a bit and then tap one of the restaurants

## step 2: Menu for the selected restaurant

You should now see a nice sectioned list of available menu items
Ordered primarily by category and secondarily by rank (if available)

Tap an entry.

Magically a shopping cart will sneak onto your screen from below.
Whatever you tapped will be added to it
Tap more things! Tap All The Things! TAP ALL THE PIZZA SALADS (they are free so go wild!)

(Future feature: Being able to remove things from the cart!)

Once you're all tapped out, tap "Show Cart"

Make sure you're happy with the contents of the cart.
Meditate on the meaning of pizza.

Tap "Send order"

Close eyes and pretend that the progress indicator is something pretty and impressive

## step 3:

Be amazed at how the order should have been delivered 24.000 hours ago.
I bet it must have gone cold while in the backseat of that delorean.
